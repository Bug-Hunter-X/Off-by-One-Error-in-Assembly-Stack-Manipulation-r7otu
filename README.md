This repository contains an example of a common off-by-one error in assembly language.  The `bug.asm` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides the corrected version. This error often occurs when working with stack-based parameters and local variables. The off-by-one error can lead to unpredictable results, crashes, or corrupted data. Understanding stack frame layout and pointer arithmetic is essential to prevent this type of error. The solutions provided illustrates best practices for addressing this.
